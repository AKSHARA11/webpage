<h2>Overview</h2>
Online Social Networks, being popular mediums for mass communications, become attractive platforms for blackmarket syndicates to provide handsome offers to users. This in turn manipulates many decision making processes such as deciding trending topics, measuring impact of social profiles etc.
In this project, we are focusing on detecting and analyzing various types of collusive activities:
1. Collusive Follower Detection: We build real-world tools to detect followers which are manifested by blackmarket agencies
2. Collusive Retweeter Detection: We aim at developing unsupervised and supervised mechanisms to detect retweeters who are controlled by blackmarkets.
3. Collusive Review Detection: We focus on building tools to detect reviews in E-commerce sites or discussion forums, which are controlled by blackmarket services to promote and demote products.
