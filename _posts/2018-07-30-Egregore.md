We are happy to announce that <b>Dr. Tanmoy Chakraborty</b> has received an “unconstrained faculty award” from Financials Markets Technology start-up Egregore Labs. For the next year, LCS2 and Egregore Labs will be jointly working on problems related to data science to implement cutting-edge industry ideas. We are confident that our research will not only enhance state-of-the-art in data science, but also lead to the development of real-world products that the industry can incorporate into their systems. LCS2 members Tushar and Vasu have been instrumental in building this collaboration and will be working in this project for one year.
